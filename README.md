# prostate_volume_estimation

The dataset and the codes for the journal "ESTIMATION OF THE PROSTATE VOLUME FROM ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND IMAGES BY IMAGE PATCH VOTING" will be here, after the acceptance of the paper.

Representation of the voting arcs and diameter endpoint estimations of our system for 300 AUS patient samples are shared at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a5wZbB8ZaPG0ZJhgVUpSYvfOF84e8acH?usp=sharing

Here are two sample images from transverse plane for a patient sample. Voting arcs without tickness are shown on the first image. Detected points (green dots) and expert markings (red dots) are shown on second images.
