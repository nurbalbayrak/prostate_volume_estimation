Representation of the voting arcs and diameter endpoint estimations of our system for 300 AUS patient samples are shared at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a5wZbB8ZaPG0ZJhgVUpSYvfOF84e8acH?usp=sharing

Here are two sample images from the transverse plane for a patient sample. Voting arcs without thickness are shown on the first image, while detected points (green dots) and expert markings (red dots) are shown on the second image.
